This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to showcase the error when [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and [Canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) are used in the same project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Either Sharp or Canvas will error. I'm not sure if this is an issue with either one of the packages, NextJS or Webpack.
